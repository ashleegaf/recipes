        <p><em>Original recipe written (in Spanish) <strong><a href="https://www.hondurastips.hn/2015/04/10/horchata-hondurena-un-magico-elixir/">here</a></strong>.</em></p>

        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p><strong>Horchata</strong> <em>(pronounced or-CHA-tah)</em> <strong>is a rice drink consumed in various Central American countries</strong> and brought to the region by European conquistadors. As seeds available in the region differ from those of Europe, the recipe I'll be sharing below varies notably in taste from what can be found in Europe, specifically Italy, today. A key feature of horchata for me is the absence of dairy in its most traditional state, which elevates the drink to star status in my mind (and stomach)! While restaurants sometimes add cream and/or milk to produce a more creamy drink, doing so is not required to make the drink delicious. Horchata also <strong>stands out for being a rich source of various vitamins and minerals owing to the presence of various nut seeds</strong>. And with that said, keep reading for a refreshing, Honduran-style horchata!
