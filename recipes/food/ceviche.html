        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p><strong>Ceviche</strong> <em>(pronounced seh-VEE-cheh)</em> <strong>is often considered the national dish of Peru</strong>, as it's the most well-known culinary export of the country. The dish remains a staple in Peruvian homes but has also traveled far and wide to reach the dinner tables of many other Latin American countries, as well as mine! While the exact origins of ceviche are unknown, there are several theories substantiating its development; this includes a theory on the word "ceviche" being derived from the quechua word "siwichi". Read more about the history of ceviche <em>(in Spanish)</em> <strong><a href="https://www.lavanguardia.com/comer/tendencias/20210628/7556270/como-nacio-cebiche-plato-bandera-gastronomia-peruana.html">here</a></strong>. <strong>Ceviche refers to the preparation of fresh fish with acid juice (from citrus fruits like lime and tumbo) and salt</strong>. As sour is one of my top two flavor profiles, I love ceviche. If you also love eating fish and sour foods, you'll definitely want to keep reading for a Peruvian-style, classic ceviche dish!
