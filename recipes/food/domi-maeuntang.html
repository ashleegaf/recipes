        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Domi Maeuntang is the <strong>Korean name for spicy seafood stew with snapper fish</strong> as the star of the show. Domi means snapper, while maeuntang translates to spicy soup or stew. As a big fan of spicy food, fish, and soups, I loved the soup from first taste, and am always excited when I happen to see it on the menu at Korean restaurants. The recipe is too delicious to not share with the world. If you also love fish soup or enjoy eating spicy food, keep reading!</p>
